Truly in ‚ù§Ô∏è with programming and software development in general. Crafting web and mobile apps with `csharp` and `dotnet`, to be exact with `aspnetcore` and `xamarin`.

Currently living in Sarajevo, Bosnia and Herzegovina. I enjoy being a speaker at regional and international conferences. Certifications which I hold are Xamarin Certifed Mobile Developer and Microsoft Certified Solution Associate... Lately most interested in Blazor, F#, Xamarin and Azure solutions.
